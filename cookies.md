### What is a cookie?&#x20;

A cookie is a small text file stored on your Device's hard drive when you visit a website, read an email, or install or use a software. Cookies set by the website operator are called "first party cookies", and those set by third parties are called "third-party cookies". Your web browser will keep it for a certain period of time and send it back to the web server each time you connect. They are used to keep track of your navigation. They are a useful mechanism for many different tasks, such as allowing you to navigate between pages efficiently, remembering your preferences, and improving the user experience. Some cookies are mandatory, but others are facultative and require prior consent.&#x20;

### How does Request use cookies?&#x20;

When visiting our Website, cookies may be installed on your Device. No cookies subject to prior approval will be deposited or read on your Device if you have not accepted them. To manage the collection of consents or any refusal/withdrawal of consent to the deposit and/or reading of cookies, Request uses a cookie consent manager solution. This solution is hosted on their servers and is regularly updated.

You are informed that cookies published by third parties (as listed below) may be used on the Website to offer users advertisements tailored to their interests.

Your consent or refusal to the installation of cookies, which can be modified at any time, is valid for six (6) months. At the end of this period, the banner will be displayed again so you can make your choice (consent or refusal).

### What if I change my mind about cookies?&#x20;

You may always modify your choices on cookies via the cookie consent manager at the bottom of each page of our Website.&#x20;

Through browser preferences, it is also possible to delete cookies installed in the past, including the cookies that may have saved the initial consent for the installation of cookies by this Website. However, Request informs you that by setting your browser to refuse cookies, some features, pages, and areas of the Website will not be accessible, for which Request can not be responsible. Given the objective complexity surrounding the identification of technologies based on cookies, you are encouraged to contact Request if you want any further information on our use of cookies.

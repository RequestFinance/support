# How Request Accounting Identifies Request Payments

Request Accounting simplifies transaction categorization by automatically identifying Request payments and associating them with their corresponding invoices. This feature helps you recognize your accrual activity better.

### Connecting Invoices with Transactions <a href="#h_73bfc4a00a" id="h_73bfc4a00a"></a>

When you connect a wallet used for making or receiving payments to Request Accounting, and the corresponding invoices are present in your Request Operations organization, our system automatically displays the invoice information next to the related transaction.

Important note: We only show invoices that are in a paid status, as Request Accounting can only recognize invoices once their transactions appear on the blockchain explorer.

### Handling Batch Payments Intelligently <a href="#h_2ea8bffc8f" id="h_2ea8bffc8f"></a>

Batch payments allow you to pay tens or hundreds of invoices in a single transaction. While this efficiency benefits finance managers, it traditionally creates extra work for accountants who must manually split these payments for proper recording.

Request Accounting solves this challenge by automatically:

* Splitting batch payments into individual transactions
* Including each split transaction in your transaction history reports
* Maintaining the connection to the original invoice

This automatic splitting applies to all transactions, whether they're standard payments or crypto-to-fiat payments, making accounting hassle-free regardless of payment type.

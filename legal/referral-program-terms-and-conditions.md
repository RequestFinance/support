## What is this Program about?

This referral Program (the “Program”) allows you to earn a referral reward (the “Reward”). It's easy: your referee just needs to sign up to Request Finance using your referral link, subscribe to a paying plan and pay for all of it. You will only be paid the Reward if you, and the referee, meet the criteria in these terms and conditions (“Program Terms”).

Make sure to invite your referee as soon as possible to give them enough time to do all the steps before the Program ends. In fact, you, and the referee, must meet all the criteria during the period the Program run. If either of you do not meet the criteria or only partially meet the criteria during this period, you will not receive a Reward. Request Finance may, at our sole discretion, suspend, terminate or change these Program and/or Program Terms without notice.

## Who is eligible for the Program?

Any Request Finance user who has received an invitation to the Program directly from Request Finance is eligible. You are only eligible if you have received an invitation directly from us.

## What do you need to do to earn the Reward?

To earn a Reward, you must (1) receive an invitation from Request Finance, (2) invite a referee to sign up to Request Finance using your referral link, and (3) ensure that your referee does the things we set out in these Program Terms. Except upon explicit exceptions granted by Request Finance, the maximum number of people you can refer over a year is ten. If you refer more than ten people, you will not be paid more than ten Rewards or will have to send a written request to our support team.&#x20;

## What does the referee need to do for you to earn the Reward?

For you to be eligible for the Reward, your referee must be a new user of Request Finance, sign up using your unique referral link, subscribe to a paying plan, and pay for all of it. This means that:

* They must sign up to Request Finance for the first time using your unique referral link (someone who has previously signed up will not earn you a Reward);
* Signing up means completing the sign-up process and passing our onboarding. If the invitee fails our onboarding, you will not be eligible for your Reward;
* You will not be paid a Reward if your referee reverses one of these steps. For example, if it immediately closes its Request Finance account, cancels its payment, etc.

## What are the Rewards?

You will be notified once the referee completes the above steps and are eligible for a Reward.&#x20;

The Rewards are as follows:&#x20;

## What other legal information should you know?

To be eligible for a Reward, you must comply with these Program Terms and all other terms and conditions that apply to your account. If we believe that you have engaged in any fraud or material abuse of this Program, we may, in our sole discretion, take any actions we see fit in the circumstances (for example, it would be a material abuse of this Program to orchestrate a campaign to profiteer from this Program in a way that does not result in genuine and unique new sign-ups to Request Finance). Referral links should only be used for personal and non-commercial purposes. Referral links should not be published or distributed where there is no reasonable basis for believing that all or most of the recipients are personal contacts.

Request Finance reserves the right, under its sole discretion, to reject any referee.&#x20;

Request Finance and you are independent parties. Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to create an employment, agency, joint venture, or partnership relationship between us or any of our agents or employees or any other legal arrangement that would impose liability upon one party for the act or failure to act of the other party. Neither of us shall have any express or implied power to enter into any contracts or commitments or incur any liabilities in the name of, or on behalf of, the other party or to bind the other party in any respect whatsoever.

Events beyond the control of Request Finance may occur that render the awarding of the Program impossible. Accordingly, Request Finance will not be liable for any loss, whether directly or indirectly suffered, due to an event outside of its control.&#x20;

WITHOUT PREJUDICE TO THE PROGRAM TERMS, REQUEST FINANCE’S LIABILITY TOWARDS YOU IS LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE REWARD.

You agree to comply with all applicable laws, ordinances, rules, regulations, orders, licensing and registration requirements, or other requirements of any governmental authority with jurisdiction over this Program.

In the event that any provision of these Program Terms is declared invalid, illegal, or unenforceable, the remaining provisions of it shall remain in full force and effect.

THIS PROGRAM IS GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF FRANCE AND SUBJECT TO THE EXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE COMMERCIAL COURT OF PARIS.

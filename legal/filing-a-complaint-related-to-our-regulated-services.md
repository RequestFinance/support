# Filing a complaint related to our regulated services

We provide the following electronic channels for Applicants to file a Complaint:

* Complaints submitted via e-mail: the Client can submit a complaint by sending an email to dedicated e-mail address: [support@request.finance](mailto:support@request.finance).
* Live Chat: Accessible on the website anytime via the chat modal, allowing clients to communicate with a customer support representative in real-time.

Complaints filed through these two channels will ultimately be directed to the Customer Relationship Management ("CRM") platform. A ticket will be created, and subsequent communication with the User will be done via email.

Applicants may file Complaints to the Company in any language supported by the CRM. The Company communicates with the Applicant, who has filed the Complaint in the language in which the Complaint was filed. This is subject to the condition that the Complaint is filed either in a supported language or an official language of the home Member State (Lithuania).

   * The date of receipt of the Complaint;
   * A reference to the timeline;
   * A copy of the Complaint (in case the Complaint was filed in electronic form).
2. Investigation of Complaints. The Company follows a structured and methodical approach to investigate Complaints, ensuring each case is handled fairly and transparently. The investigation process is as follows:
   * Initial Review. Acknowledge receipt of the complaint and provide an estimated response time. Conduct a preliminary assessment to determine the nature and severity of the complaint.
   * Escalation (If Necessary). If the complaint involves serious issues (e.g., fraud, security risks, compliance breaches), escalate to the relevant team (Legal, Compliance, or Technical). Assign an investigator or team to handle the case via the CRM.
   * Information Gathering. Collect relevant data from internal systems, transaction logs, and customer records. If necessary, request additional details from the Applicant or involved parties. Interview relevant stakeholders (if applicable).
   * Communication with the Applicant. Provide updates on the investigation status. Request clarifications or additional supporting documents if needed. Ensure transparency while maintaining confidentiality.
   * Final Review & Resolution Determination. Analyze the gathered information and determine an appropriate resolution. Ensure compliance with internal policies and regulatory requirements. If required, seek approval from senior management.
   * Updates & Documentation. Document the findings, resolution, and actions taken. Update internal records for compliance and future reference.
   * Resolution Communication. Inform the Applicant of the resolution, including any corrective actions taken. Provide instructions on the next steps (e.g., refunds, policy changes, appeal process). Offer escalation options if the Applicant is unsatisfied with the resolution.
3. Decisions. The Company follows a transparent and structured process for deciding on the outcome and final Handling of Complaints of its Applicants. After the initial investigation is completed, the decision-making process involves the following key steps:
   * Documentation of Findings. Compile all relevant information, including investigation reports, transaction records, customer communications, and regulatory considerations. Ensure that the documentation is clear, factual, and well-structured for internal and external reference.
   * Decision Process Regarding Financial Compensation. Assess if financial compensation is warranted based on policies, contractual obligations, and legal requirements.

   * Communication of the Decision. Inform the Applicant of the outcome in a clear and professional manner. Provide a detailed explanation, including the rationale behind the decision and any applicable policies or regulations. If financial compensation is granted, outline the payment process and expected timeline.&#x20;
   * Appeals Process. Offer the Applicant the option to appeal if they disagree with the decision. Specify the timeline and procedure for submitting an appeal (e.g., providing new evidence, requesting a second review). Escalate the appeal to a senior review team or the board if necessary.
   * Denial of Claims. If the complaint is denied, provide a clear and justified explanation, referencing policies, regulations, and investigation findings. Offer alternative solutions if applicable (e.g., additional support, policy clarification). Ensure the Applicant understands that they can escalate the matter externally if they remain unsatisfied (e.g., regulatory bodies, ombudsman services).

2. Request for additional information (if required): within 5 business days of initial review.
3. Investigating the complaint and providing a response: within 15 business days of initial review or the answer to the request for additional information if any.

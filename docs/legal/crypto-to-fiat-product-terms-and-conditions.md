### Our Crypto-to-Fiat services

We provide Crypto-to-Fiat services, including custody and administration of crypto, execution of orders for crypto-assets on behalf of clients, and transfer of Crypto-to-Fiat services for crypto-assets.

Request Technologies offers and uses an API, relying on Payment service providers (“PsP”) and other Virtual Asset Service Providers (“VASP”), to facilitate exchanges between cryptocurrency (”Crypto”) and traditional currency (”Fiat”) and handle fiat payouts through SWIFT or local payment methods such as SEPA in many countries around the world. Request Technologies offers its Crypto-to-Fiat services to business users or to other businesses (”Partners”) who want to offer fiat capabilities to their customers (”End Users”). Payments are conducted by creating “Offramps”. Creating an Offramp involves a Partner or business user notifying Request Technologies that it or an End User wants a specific amount of Fiat (”Destination Amount”) to arrive in a specific bank account (”Destination Bank”). Request Technologies returns a “Deposit Address”- a cryptocurrency wallet address dedicated to the business user or End User- to which the business user or End User transfers Crypto, and an “Exchange Rate” specifying the amount of Crypto required to fulfill the Destination Amount. Upon successful deposit, Request Technologies can choose to accept or reject the transaction based on a number of risk factors. If accepted, Request Technologies will endeavor to fulfill the delivery of the Destination Amount to the Destination Bank through its PsP partners. You authorize us to share your Data and Offramp information with our PsP partners.

You may not cancel an Offramp after we have commenced processing it. If you cancel your Offramp and you have not provided sufficient information in order for us to return your funds, we will hold your funds as required by law. You are solely responsible for reviewing your Offramp receipts for accuracy and for monitoring your Offramp history for any errors or any potentially fraudulent activity. You hereby waive your right to dispute an Offramp. You are responsible for ensuring that you- in your respective capacity as either an End User or a Partner- submit the appropriate information when you create an Offramp. In the event that the Partner creates an Offramp on behalf of an End User with details different from those submitted by the End User, any actions of remediation are the responsibility of the Partner.

Request Technologies can reject the Offramp in advance of or after the transfer of Crypto to the Deposit Address has been made. Some of the reasons for rejection include, but are not limited to: a change in the underlying value of the Fiat or Crypto currency, too much time passing between the creation of an Offramp and the completion of the Crypto deposit, suspicions on the identity of the sender or the recipient, or suspicions around the nature of the transaction.

By accessing these Crypto-to-Fiat services, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Crypto-to-Fiat services; (c) your registration and your use of the Crypto-to-Fiat services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations; and (d) you answered our KYC/KYB checks accurately and without deception. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have the authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms. If your identity information or usage of the service reveals that you are not eligible to use the service (because you are connected with a prohibited jurisdiction or otherwise), then you accept that we can close your account and prevent you from re-joining the service.&#x20;

As a regulated service, we will monitor use of your account to ensure it is in compliance with our legal guidelines (”AML Compliance Program”) on an ongoing basis to prevent financial crimes.

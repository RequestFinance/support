You always remain responsible for the integration and use of our API.

### Crypto-to-Fiat

Request Technologies offers and uses an API, relying on Payment service providers (“PsP”), to facilitate exchanges between cryptocurrency (”Crypto”) and traditional currency (”Fiat”) and handle fiat payouts through SWIFT or local payment methods such as SEPA in many countries around the world. Request Technologies offers its services to business users or to other businesses (”Partners”) who want to offer fiat capabilities to their customers (”End Users”). Payments are conducted by creating “Offramps”. Creating an Offramp involves a Partner or business user notifying Request Technologies that it or an End User wants a specific amount of Fiat (”Destination Amount”) to arrive in a specific bank account (”Destination Bank”). Request Technologies returns a “Deposit Address”- a cryptocurrency wallet address dedicated to the business user or End User- to which the business user or End User transfers Crypto, and an “Exchange Rate” specifying the amount of Crypto required to fulfill the Destination Amount. Upon successful deposit, Request Technologies can choose to accept or reject the transaction based on a number of risk factors. If accepted, Request Technologies will endeavor to fulfill the delivery of the Destination Amount to the Destination Bank through its PsP partners. You authorize us to share your Data and Offramp information with our PsP partners.

You may not cancel an Offramp after we have commenced processing it. If you cancel your Offramp and you have not provided sufficient information in order for us to return your funds, we will hold your funds as required by law. You are solely responsible for reviewing your Offramp receipts for accuracy and for monitoring your Offramp history for any errors or any potentially fraudulent activity. You hereby waive your right to dispute an Offramp. You are responsible for ensuring that you- in your respective capacity as either an End User or a Partner- submit the appropriate information when you create an Offramp. In the event that the Partner creates an Offramp on behalf of an End User with details different from those submitted by the End User, any actions of remediation are the responsibility of the Partner.

Request Technologies can reject the Offramp in advance of or after the transfer of Crypto to the Deposit Address has been made. Some of the reasons for rejection include, but are not limited to: a change in the underlying value of the Fiat or Crypto currency, too much time passing between the creation of an Offramp and the completion of the Crypto deposit, suspicions on the identity of the sender or the recipient, or suspicions around the nature of the transaction.

By accessing these services, you represent and warrant to us that: (a) you are at least 18 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the services; (c) your registration and your use of the services is in compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations; and (d) you answered our KYC/KYB checks accurately and without deception. If you are an entity, organization, or company, the individual accepting these Terms on your behalf represents and warrants that they have the authority to bind you to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these Terms. If your identity information or usage of the service reveals that you are not eligible to use the service (because you are connected with a prohibited jurisdiction or otherwise), then you accept that we can close your account and prevent you from re-joining the service.&#x20;

As a regulated service, we will monitor use of your account to ensure it is in compliance with our legal guidelines (”AML Compliance Program”) on an ongoing basis to prevent financial crimes.

### KYC, KYB, KYT & AML

To grant you access to some of our services (Crypto-to-fiat, etc.), we may, at our sole discretion or as otherwise required by law, conduct appropriate Know-Your-Business (KYB) and/or Anti-Money Laundering (AML) procedures, for which you will need to register in full and provide us with specified documents and information to prove and establish your identity.&#x20;

During registration, you may need to provide, including but not limited to, your full name and/or the full legal name of the entity that you represent or acting on behalf of, whenever applicable, residential address or incorporation/business address, date of birth or date of incorporation, nationality, contact number, and email address.&#x20;

The KYC/KYB documentation that we may request may include, but not limited to the following:

* Proof of identity or incorporation, including any relevant business registration documents, annual returns etc.;
* Proof of address/financial documents, such as bank statements;
* Articles of Association & shareholding chart;
* Proof of source of funds or wealth, for example investment statements or SAFE agreements.&#x20;

We may suspend, terminate or reject your account or the business relationship until a satisfactory identification document or documentary evidence on the source of funds or wealth is provided. If any of your KYB documentation expires or is no longer valid, we have the right to request additional valid and non-expired KYB documentation from you.&#x20;

You agree to allow your information (individual or corporate) to be disclosed to Request Technologies’s service providers for the purposes of KYB verification and any other screening checks. You further agree, represent, and warrant that by providing us your information, including information on any related or connected parties, you undertake that the disclosure of any personal data to Request Technologies is for our purpose and is within the scope of the consent given to you by such related or connected parties.

We only authorize Offramps using funds belonging to the user. You are not allowed to use funds that do not belong to you to place Offramps, and you cannot place Offramps on behalf of a third party. Each time you place an Offramp, you are promising that you own the funds used by you to execute the Offramp, and that the funds are not the direct or indirect proceeds of any criminal or fraudulent activity. To respect the best standards in the field of AML, we are processing KYT controls for every new Offramp you will process. Then, we may limit the amount and frequency of your Offramps in a given time period. These limits may depend on when you opened your account, the Personal Data you provided us, and a variety of other risk factors.

You will not use the Request Technologies services to undertake or enable by you or any third party (the “Prohibited Activities List”): unlawful or abusive activity, fraud, unlawful gambling, intellectual property infringement, investment or credit services, check cashing, bail bonds, collections agencies, counterfeit or unauthorized goods, drugs, and drug paraphernalia (including pseudo pharmaceuticals), substances designed to mimic illegal drugs, illegal adult content and services, multi-level marketing, unfair, predatory or deceptive practices, money services, and any business that Request Technologies believes poses elevated financial risk, legal liability, or violate card network rules or bank policies.

By using our Services, you acknowledge and agree (i) that Request or related entities are not responsible for the operation of the underlying cryptographic systems, software, and networks; (ii) that there exists no guarantee of the functionality, security, or availability of such cryptographic systems, software and networks; and (iii) that the underlying protocols are subject to sudden changes in operating rules (known as "Forks"), and that such Forks may materially affect the Services.

You acknowledge that Request might discretionarily decide not to support (or cease supporting) forked networks or any network without prior notice. You also acknowledge and agree that Request assumes no responsibility whatsoever regarding any underlying software protocols, whether forked or not. Our Services rely partly on third-party and open-source software, including the Ethereum Blockchain, and the continued development and support.

This may have a material adverse effect on our Services.

Advances in code cracking or technical advances, such as the development of quantum computers, may present risks to cryptographic systems, software, and networks. It could result in the theft or loss of any user’s cryptographic tokens or property.

You accept that the cost of transacting on such technologies is variable and may increase at any time, causing an impact on any activities taking place on any blockchain. You are responsible for identifying and satisfying all such additional fees and charges.

You acknowledge these risks and represent that Request or any related entity or person cannot be held liable for such fluctuations or increased costs.

The terms, "Commission", "Controller", "Data Subject", "Member State", "Personal Data", "Personal Data Breach", "Processing" and "Supervisory Authority" shall have the same meaning as in the GDPR, and their cognate terms shall be construed accordingly.

Before making your first invoice with Request Finance, you have to set up your account. This is done so you can easily access all your invoices in one place using the dashboard, which will be covered later.

Registering an account can be done by following this link: [https://app.request.finance/signup](https://app.request.finance/signup)

After successfully signing up, you will receive a verification mail to verify you have access to the email address youâ€™ve registered your account with. After verifying your email, you will be able to create your first invoice.

## Creating a digital currency invoice in a few simple steps

**Before you continue:** You will receive the payment of your invoice directly from your client â€“ no middleman. Be sure to double-check and fill in this information correctly, especially the wallet address. We wonâ€™t be able to help recover your funds when sent to an address you donâ€™t control.
